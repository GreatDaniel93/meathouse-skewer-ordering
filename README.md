## Dining rules
- 90-minute dining session
- Last order 15 minutes before session end
- Skewer reorder cooldown: 5 minutes by default, manager-editable
- Order cap by guest equivalent: 1–2 = 4, 3–4 = 6, 5–6 = 8, 7+ = 10 skewers per round
- Each menu item also has a manager-editable max-per-round setting
- No Starter Platter logic
